# NFL-Modeling


The CSV file used to model is made up of features found on various sources from the web, as well as features that I've engineered myself.
The code for that is quite messy, so I'll clean it before adding it to the repo, but the CSV is the result of all the feature engineering.


Following the notebook will allow you to see my basic method for predicting betting outcomes for the 2018-19 NFL season using scikit-learn models

You can add your own features, select your own features, try different modeling techniques, use different methods of performance evaluation to try and come up with the best solution.
